#### Process

1. hand in the concept before the given deadline sometime within the first half of the semester
2. receive short-term feedback and sanity-check via email
3. present your implementation in a review session at the end of the semester
4. check in last commit by the end of the review day

*Please note, that it's not required to successfully completely finish the implementation in order to pass (grade: 4.0)
